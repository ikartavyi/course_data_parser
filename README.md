# Historical weather conditions parser
I've created this parser to parse the data from https://www.almanac.com/weather/history/MI/Detroit/ for my course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting) final assignment.

But it was made as a flexible solution so it could be used to parse any other data as well.
